"pytest has a long and interesting history. The `first commit "
"<https://github.com/pytest-"
"dev/pytest/commit/5992a8ef21424d7571305a8d7e2a3431ee7e1e23>`__ in this "
"repository is from January 2007, and even that commit alone already tells"
" a lot: The repository originally was from the :pypi:`py` library (later "
"split off to pytest), and it originally was a SVN revision, migrated to "
"Mercurial, and finally migrated to git."

"However, the commit says “create the new development trunk” and is "
"already quite big: *435 files changed, 58640 insertions(+)*. This is "
"because pytest originally was born as part of `PyPy "
"<https://www.pypy.org/>`__, to make it easier to write tests for it. "
"Here's how it evolved from there to its own project:"

"Like that blog post mentioned, from very early on, there was a big focus "
"on testing. There were various ``testsupport`` files on top of "
"unittest.py, and as early as June 2003, Holger Krekel (:user:`hpk42`) "
"`refactored <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pypy-"
"dev/2003-June/000787.html>`__ its test framework to clean things up "
"(``pypy.tool.test``, but still on top of ``unittest.py``, with nothing "
"pytest-like yet)."

"However, it didn’t seem to be around for long, as around June/July 2004, "
"efforts started on a thing called ``utest``, offering plain assertions. "
"This seems like the start of something pytest-like, but unfortunately, "
"it's unclear where the test runner's code was at the time. The closest "
"thing still around is `this file "
"<https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/0735f9ed287ec20950a7dd0a16fc10810d4f6847>`__,"

"seen is that there were `various efforts "
